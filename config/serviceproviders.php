/**
 * Application Service Providers
 *
 * The application's own service providers, loaded in declared order. These are
 * app-local classes (not composer-discovered extensions) and are always loaded.
 * Use string FQCNs (no ::class) so tooling can edit the list safely.
 *
 * Thallo's internal modules (packages/thallo-*) live here — they are library-typed
 * composer path packages, NOT installable extensions (modules-not-extensions spec,
 * 2026-07-25): always loaded, feature exposure controlled by the thallo.capabilities
 * switchboard. Their cross-phase order is declared on the providers themselves
 * (DeclaresLoadOrder: post-extension tier, list order as the stable tie-break) —
 * this list's order is documentation, not the dependency mechanism.
